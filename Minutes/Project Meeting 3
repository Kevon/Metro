Last week we expanded the board to the new size, created all the new tile classes, and modified all the classes to use the new setup.

We fixed the text UI for the new board layout and set it up to accept different number of players and properly assign stations. Once we fix a few little things to get everything to work with the new setup, we will create the GUI.

We still need to implement the save game feature and the GUI features.
