Metting 1, 3/21/2012

Future meetings will be after lecture on Mondays and Fridays and on weekends as neccessary

Planned Classes:
  
  Board
    
    private class Space (the 16 spaces on the board)
    
      in charge of a Tile
    
    somehow in charge of its input/output edges, perhaps with another private class

  Tile
    
    possible private class Edge, depending upon how Tile gets implemented

  Tile Stack
    
    Stack based list to draw tiles from for play

  Output
    
    in charge of printing out all necessary info for players.  Therefore most classes will have accessor methods.

  Player

    keeps track of score

One of the classes should keep track of the turn, perhaps Board, not sure yet

Next Meeting:

  Friday, 3/23/2012

  Look at classes and their required methods, write tests.
  
    focus on Board and Tile methods/tests, esp interactions between Board, Space, and Tile
