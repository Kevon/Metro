Got Done:
	Writing the tile class and the board class

Need to:
	Make sure the board can't make illegal moves
	Over-arcing "Game" Class
	Player Class
	Station Class
	Need to write tests for those three classes, then write the classes
	Then do the GUI, which will be an extra functionality of the "Game" class
	
	Meet to program on Friday and Monday after class, maybe next Wednesday after class if time requires it
